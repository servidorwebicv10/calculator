# Web Calculator

This project is a basic calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** as a practice project to improve programming logic and DOM manipulation skills.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Decimal number support
- Modern futuristic UI design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid layout + visual effects)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation and operation logic)

## Project Structure
```
 calculator
│-- index.html
│-- calculadora.css
│-- calculadora.js
```

## How It Works

1. The user enters the first number.
2. Selects a mathematical operation.
3. Enters the second number.
4. Presses "=" to display the result.

The logic is implemented in JavaScript using variables to store:
- First number
- Second number
- Operation type
- Result

## Project Purpose

This project was created to practice:

- DOM manipulation
- Handling `onclick` events
- Conditional logic
- Using `parseFloat()` for mathematical operations

## Possible Future Improvements

- Add clear button (C / AC)
- Keyboard input support
- Error handling (e.g., division by zero)
- Chained operations
- Refactor into cleaner reusable functions
